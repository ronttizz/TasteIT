## TasteIT - Recipe App

School project made with React using Hooks. Database is ran on JSON-server.

## Running the project

After installing needed node modules, run NPM START to see the app, run NPM RUN SERVER to run the development JSON-server.

App runs on port:3000 and json-server on port:3010

If you cant see the recipes on /recipe page you probably don't have json-server running properly. Make sure that the port for json-server is 3010.
